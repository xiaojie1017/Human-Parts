# Detector-in-Detector: Multi-Level Analysis for Human-Parts (ACCV'2018)
### Xiaojie Li, Lu Yang, Qing Song, Fuqiang Zhou

This repository hosts the **Human-Parts dataset** used in our DID-Net (Detector-in-Detector Network). Our work, presented at ACCV 2018, introduces a novel framework that enhances detection performance by leveraging the inherent correlation between the human body and its parts. We utilize a region-based detection structure with dual detectors that focus on the human body and body parts in a hierarchical manner.

The **Human-Parts** dataset, essential for training our model, comprises 14,962 images and 106,879 annotations, targeting various aspects of the human form, such as the body, face, and hands. We invite researchers to utilize this dataset for related tasks and applications in computer vision.

### Highlights of DID-Net:
- Multi-level object detection framework
- Coarse-to-fine analysis via dual detectors
- Trained end-to-end on a newly collected and labeled dataset
- Demonstrates significant improvements in detecting multi-level human-related objects
